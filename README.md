## Examples

All examples are in the [notebooks](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/tree/master/notebooks) folder.

Below is a simple demonstration from [test.py](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/blob/master/notebooks/test.py) in [notebooks](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/tree/master/notebooks) on how to improve spectral partitioning using flow-based methods from local graph clustering.

```python
from localgraphclustering import *

import time
import numpy as np

# Read graph. This also supports gml and graphml format.
g = GraphLocal('./datasets/senate.edgelist','edgelist',' ')

# Call the global spectral partitioning algorithm.
eig2 = fiedler(g)

# Round the eigenvector
output_sc = sweep_cut(g,eig2)

# Extract the partition for g and store it.
eig2_rounded = output_sc[0]

# Conductance before improvement
print("Conductance before improvement:",g.compute_conductance(eig2_rounded))

# Start calling SimpleLocal
start = time.time()
output_SL_fast = SimpleLocal(g,eig2_rounded)
end = time.time()
print("running time:",str(end-start)+"s")

# Conductance after improvement
print("Conductance after improvement:",g.compute_conductance(output_SL_fast[0]))

output_SL = output_SL_fast[0]
```

## Examples with visualization

For general examples with visualization using our built-in drawing methods, see the Jupyter notebook [examples with visualization](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/blob/master/notebooks/new_visualization_examples.ipynb).

For comparisons of spectral- and flow-based methods with visualization see the Jupyter notebooks [here](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/blob/master/notebooks/spectral_vs_flow_with_visualization.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/blob/master/notebooks/spectral_vs_flow_2_with_visualization.ipynb).

For visual demonstration of algorithms that can improve a given seed set of nodes see the Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/blob/master/notebooks/improveType_algorithms_with_visualization.ipynb).

## Scalable graph analytics on your laptop

For examples using reasonably large graphs (100 million edges) on a 16GB RAM laptop please see the Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/blob/master/notebooks/examples_scalable_graph_analytics.ipynb).

## When local graph clustering methods do not perform well?

In theory and in practice we have observed that the performance of local graph clustering methods
depends on the magnitute of the conductance of the target cluster as well as the magnitute of the minimum conductance
in the induced subgraph of the target cluster. Simply put, if the "internal connectivity" of the target cluster (the minimum conductance
in the induced subgraph of the target cluster) is not stronger than the "external connectivity" (the conductance of the target cluster) then local graph clustering methods have poor performance in terms of finding the target cluster. For theoretical details please see Section 3 in the [Capacity Releasing Diffusion for Speed and Locality](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/wang17b.html) paper. For extensive numerical experiments that demonstrate properties of challenging target clusters please see Section 4 in [Capacity Releasing Diffusion for Speed and Locality](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/wang17b.html) as well as the supplementary material in the same link.


## Installation

```
Clone the repo
```
```
Enter the folder using the termimal
```
```
Type in the terminal `python setup.py install`
```
Note that this package runs only with Python 3 on Mac or Linux.

## Import from Julia

1. In Julia, add the PyCall package: 
   
   `Pkg.add("PyCall")`
2. Update which version of Python that PyCall defaults to:

    `ENV["PYTHON"] = (path to python3 executable) `

    `Pkg.build("PyCall")`

    (You can get the path to the python3 executable by just running "which python3" in the terminal.)
3. Make sure the PyPlot package is added in Julia.â€¨
4. Import *localgraphclustering* by using:

   `using PyPlot`
   
   `using PyCall`

   `@pyimport localgraphclustering`

You can now use any routine in *localgraphluserting* from Julia.
