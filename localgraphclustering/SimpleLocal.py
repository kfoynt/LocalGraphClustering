    Parameters
    ----------

    inputs: Sequence[Graph]

    ref_node: Sequence[Sequence[int]]
        The reference node, i.e., node of interest around which
        we are looking for a target cluster.

    delta: float
        locality parameter

    relcondflag: bool, default is True
        a boolean flag indicating whether to compute the relative
        conductance score or the exact conductance score for each
        intermediate improved set. Choosing false (i.e. updating with
        exact conductance) will sometimes lead to fewer iterations and
        lower conductance output, but will not actually minimize the
        relative conductance or seed penalized conductance. Choosing true
        will guarantee the returned set is connected.
            
    Returns
    -------
        
    It returns in a list of length 2 with the following:
        
    output 0: list
        Stores indices of the best clusters found by the last called rounding procedure.
           
    output 1: float
        Stores the value of the best conductance found by the last called rounding procedure.
